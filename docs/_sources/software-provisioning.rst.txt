Software Provisioning
======================
Provisioning software in a scalable, containerized way facilitates automated software deployment onto devices.
Tracking multiple versions of binaries and configurations becomes exponentially difficult as the number of devices and applications increase.  

Software provisioning involves defining custom software configuration recipes, describing the sequence of jobs and processes to execute on device boot.
This includes the following:

- Define the boot order of jobs and processes
- Configure jobs for automatic restart upon process failure
- Manage and switch between multiple software configurations
- Manage over-the-air (OTA) updates

`PSYGIG Mobility IoT SDK` includes tools to manage the complexity of software provisioning.

Using ``angelo``
-----------------
With a single command, ``angelo`` automatically provisions software onto a device specified by a configuration file ``angelo.yml``.
An example file is as follows.

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:

    version: '1.0'

    services:
      obstacle-detection:
        command: objdetect --people --cars
      slam:
        command: slam --config default.cfg
      path-finding:
        command: pf --algorithm a-star

Under ``services``, an arbitrary name is defined for each service, along with the command line to execute.

Once the recipe has been configured, run ``angelo start`` to start all services.

See :doc:`angelo-man` for a complete list of options.
