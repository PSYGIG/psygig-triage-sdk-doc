``psymon`` man page
===================
``psymon`` is a script that uses the ``LD_PRELOAD`` enviroment variable of the dynamic linker to inject new functionality
into your programs without re-compiling your source code. ``LD_PRELOAD`` instructs the dynamic linker to load the 
``libpsygig`` library before running your application, allowing the library to perform the necessary initializations in order
to monitor your application. This includes installation application profiling, system metric collection and crash reporting routines.

.. note::
    ``psymon`` is a work-in-progress.
