``angelo`` man page
===================
``angelo`` is a multiplatform device management tool for provisioning, monitoring and diagnosing embedded and cloud-enabled IoT devices.
With a single command, any device can be provisioned and monitored as specified by the configuration file.

``angelo`` enables software provisioning by managing the software binaries and configurations to be executed on the device. 
Once the device is in operation, ``angelo`` provides real-time monitoring of device health, including system resource metrics, logs, and events.
