Module Marketplace
======================
Module Marketplace is a repository of 3rd party modules for custom video and data processing that can be installed directly onto a device.
Instead of implementing a module from scratch, one that already exists in the marketplace may be installed directly on the device.
Examples of such modules include the following computer vision/AI-based modules:

- People counting
- Gender/age classification
- Emotion classification
- Action recognition
- Fall detection
- Crack/damage detection

`PSYGIG Mobility IoT SDK` provides the ``angelo`` command line tool for managing and installing modules from the Module Marketplace.

Using ``angelo``
----------------
Installing a module from the marketplace can be performed with a single command ``angelo install [module]``, where `module` is the name of the module in the marketplace.

.. code-block:: bash

   angelo install people-counting

Once the module has been downloaded and installed, run ``angelo run [module]`` to run the module.

.. code-block:: bash

   angelo run people-counting

See :doc:`angelo-man` for a complete list of options.
